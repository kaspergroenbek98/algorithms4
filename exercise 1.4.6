a.
since n is halfed in each iteration, we get a geometric sequence of 1, 1/2, 1/4,..., 1/n.
this means that the inner loop is executed lg(N) * (N + N/2 + N/4 + N/8 + ... + N/N) times.
Finially, this means that the loop is executed approximately N*lg(N)
Which can be approximated to O(N)

b.
Here N is doubled each time, making it so that i quadradicly increases.
This will be the same as above, where the outer loop is executed lg(N) times,
and the inner loop will end up finally being executed N-times.
This makes it simplified to N*lg(N), which can be approximated to O(N)

c.
Will be simplified to O(N lg(N)), which is approximated to O(N).
